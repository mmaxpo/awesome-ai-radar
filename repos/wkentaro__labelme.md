## 📦 Recent releases

### [v7.11.0](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases/tag/v7.11.0)
<sub>2026-11-14 · today</sub>

> **Changed**
> - SAM 3 asks to be downloaded again, as 1.8 GB on a GPU or 3.7 GB on the CPU, and asks again for its CPU files when AI falls back to the CPU. Its files from earlier versions stay on disk. ([#3099](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/3099))
> - AI no longer retries a request on the CPU when the GPU fails partway through; the next request loads the model again. The status bar no longer shows "Preparing image…". ([#3100](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/3100))
> **Fixed**
> - The model menu shows the download size for the AI device: SAM 3 shows about 1.8 GB on a GPU instead of its CPU size. ([#3104](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/3104))
> - Deleting an AI model no longer freezes the window while AI runs, and other loaded models stay loaded. ([#3105](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/3105))
> …

### [v7.10.0](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases/tag/v7.10.0)
<sub>2026-11-13 · yesterday</sub>

> **Added**
> - Allow drawing Polygon and LineStrip paths by dragging, simplifying strokes into fewer vertices while preserving click-to-add input. ([#2757](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2757))
> - Add 3-point circle mode (`circle_3p`) to draw circles by clicking three points on the circumference. ([#2788](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2788))
> - Open JPEG 2000 Images (.jp2, .jpx, .j2k, .j2c) through Pillow with OpenJPEG support, including folder scanning and drag-and-drop, while preserving decoded pixels and transparency in memory. ([#2833](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2833))
> - `labelme.log` records the platform, the installed AI runtime versions, and how long each AI model takes to load, encode an image and generate annotations, to help debug GPU problems. ([#2849](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2849))
> - A Compute device Setting runs AI on the CPU, and the status bar shows while AI is running and whether it runs on the CPU. ([#2861](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2861))
> …

### [v7.9.1](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases/tag/v7.9.1)
<sub>2026-10-25 · 20d ago</sub>

> **Fixed**
> - Fix a point dragged inside a box being lost on image switch, because the move was never saved or added to undo history. ([#2845](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2845))
> - Hovering where Shapes overlap now highlights the Shape a click selects, so a point drawn inside a box is highlighted and picked over the box. ([#2846](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2846))

### [v7.9.0](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases/tag/v7.9.0)
<sub>2026-10-20 · 25d ago</sub>

> **Added**
> - Allow double-clicking a shape on the canvas to open the label-edit dialog. ([#2744](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2744))
> - Lock shapes against editing with Lock Shapes / Unlock Shapes (`Ctrl+Shift+L`); the lock is saved per shape as `"locked": true` in the annotation file. ([#2755](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2755))
> - Add Fit to Selection (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) to the View menu and toolbar, a zoom mode that fits the view to the selected shapes, with padding, whenever the selection changes. ([#2758](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2758))
> - Labelme remembers the Annotation Folder for each opened folder across restarts, including one given with `--output`, which Labelme now creates at startup if it is missing. ([#2775](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2775))
> - The Image List has a footer that shows the Annotation Folder and how many images are annotated, for example "3 of 5 annotated · next to images", with Change Annotation Folder… and an option to go back to saving next to images. A remembered folder that is missing shows a warning there. ([#2776](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2776), [#2778](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2778), [#2808](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2808))
> …

### [v7.8.1](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases/tag/v7.8.1)
<sub>2026-10-07 · 1mo ago</sub>

> **Fixed**
> - Avoid image hashing when loading images while preserving AI embedding reuse when revisiting unchanged images. ([#2741](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/pull/2741))
